    <!--<div style="position:absolute;left:10;top:600;font-size:23px;">Something went wrong exporting the video. I tried to fix it but different problems then came up.</div>
    <div style="position:absolute;left:10;top:630;font-size:17px;">
        Corrections:
        <br>- Title should say "Economics Stock Project"
        <br>- Reddit Logo was transparent in the editor and no longer is. 
        <br>- 9/11 in the Palantir History shouldn't be on two lines
        <br>- "Everyone wants shiny" should be "Everyone wants shiny rocks" (this is a real shame that it messed up)
        <br>- On that same part there should be the word "currency" at the end
        <br>- In the outperforming explaination, "Palantir." was cut off at the end.
